# LibriSpeech-Long

**[Download audio, ground-truth transcripts, and per-file durations for all splits (3GB).](https://storage.googleapis.com/librispeech_long/v0_1.tar.gz)** 

This is a benchmark dataset for evaluating long-form variants of speech processing tasks such as speech continuation, speech recognition, and text-to-speech synthesis. It is derived from the [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) dev and test sets, whose utterances are reprocessed into contiguous examples of up to 4 minutes in length (in the manner of [LibriLight's `cut_by_vad.py` script](https://github.com/facebookresearch/libri-light/blob/main/data_preparation/cut_by_vad.py)).

**For more details:** see "Long-Form Speech Generation with Spoken Language Models" ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18603), [website](https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/)).

*This is part of a preprint that is work-in-progress; dataset may be subject to change.*
